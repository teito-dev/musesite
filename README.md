# Roadmap 
- [ ] Allow people to host their museapp exported files as individual webpages exactly in the format that it looks on iPad (read-only) (support mobile, laptop, desktop)

- [ ] Update the Readme and make it easier to read-understand-install
- [ ] Allow people to build and host their own websites in museapp itself ! (make it as easy and beginner friendly as possible to self-host this)
- [ ] Allow creating personal webpage with all museapp files exported and stored to allow a search interface like : https://mymind.com/
- [ ] A chrome-extension to import all sorts of asset with rich preview formats into museapp
- [ ] Build an awesome-plugin kinda list for museapp plugins
